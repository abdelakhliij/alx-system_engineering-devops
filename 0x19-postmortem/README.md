Postmortem: Web Application Outage
Issue Summary
Duration of the Outage:

Start Time: June 5, 2024, 14:00 UTC
End Time: June 5, 2024, 16:30 UTC
Impact:

The main web application was completely inaccessible. Users experienced a 503 Service Unavailable error. Approximately 90% of users were affected during the outage period.

Root Cause:

The root cause was a misconfiguration in the load balancer that led to all traffic being directed to a single, overloaded web server.
Timeline
14:00 UTC: Issue detected via a monitoring alert indicating a high error rate on the web application.
14:05 UTC: Initial investigation began by the on-call engineer, confirming the 503 errors.
14:10 UTC: Assumed cause was a potential application deployment issue, and rollback was initiated.
14:30 UTC: Rollback completed, but the issue persisted.
14:35 UTC: Further investigation into the database showed normal operation.
15:00 UTC: Issue escalated to the network operations team.
15:15 UTC: Network team identified unusual traffic patterns and focused on the load balancer configuration.
15:30 UTC: Misconfiguration in the load balancer discovered, directing all traffic to one server.
15:35 UTC: Load balancer configuration corrected to properly distribute traffic.
15:45 UTC: Monitoring showed gradual recovery.
16:30 UTC: Full service restored, confirmed by monitoring tools.
Root Cause and Resolution
Root Cause:

During a routine update to the load balancer configuration, a syntax error was introduced. This error caused the load balancer to direct all incoming traffic to a single web server instead of distributing it across the server pool. The single server became overwhelmed and started returning 503 errors, leading to the outage.
Resolution:

The network operations team identified the misconfiguration by reviewing the load balancerâ€™s configuration files and logs. They corrected the syntax error and reloaded the load balancer configuration. Traffic was then properly distributed across the web servers, allowing the system to recover gradually. Monitoring tools confirmed the resolution as the error rates dropped and user access was restored.
Corrective and Preventative Measures
Improvements/Fixes:

Configuration Management:
Implement more rigorous testing for load balancer configuration changes in a staging environment before applying them to production.
2. Monitoring and Alerts:

Enhance monitoring to detect load distribution anomalies and not just high error rates.
3. Documentation and Training:

Update documentation on load balancer configuration and provide additional training to the network operations team on common pitfalls.
Tasks to Address the Issue:

Patch Load Balancer Configuration:
Review and patch the current load balancer configuration files to prevent similar syntax errors.
2. Add Load Distribution Monitoring:

Implement and configure monitoring tools to alert on uneven traffic distribution across servers.
3. Develop Staging Environment:

Set up a comprehensive staging environment to test all load balancer configuration changes.
4. Update Documentation:

Update the internal documentation to include a checklist for configuration changes.
5. Conduct Training Sessions:

Schedule training sessions for the network operations team focused on load balancer configuration best practices.
